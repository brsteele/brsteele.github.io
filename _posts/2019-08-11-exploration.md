Transitioning to the new role and you know, moving across the country has been fairly busy. While a lot of time has been consumed by VSCO and logistics, I have had some space to explore SF.

I've really enjoyed walking the neighborhoods, including my own. I live (for now...) at the top of a hill on the border of the Mission and the Castro. The view is beautiful, but the walk home is...intense. On an average weekend day, I'll put in 30k-40k steps and around 20ish miles of walking. Yesterday, my son, Jacie and I walked to the FiDi (sounding more like a SF native...right?!?) and then we went from home to Ocean Beach and then up to the Golden Gate bridge. My son had never seen it, and if I'm being honest, he still hasn't as the bridge was COMPLETELY enveloped in fog. Below is an image of him headed down the stairs from the bridge to Crissy field.

Making 'things' is always a challenge, but one I'm enjoying. The exploration continues...
