One of the things I promised myself when I accepted a new job with [VSCO](http://vsco.co) in the Bay Area (more to come there) was that I'd get back into photography. I used to do it as a semi-ft gig. I'm fairly certain I wasn't great at it (maybe not even that good) but I enjoyed it and I made some money doing it. Moving, kids, life, etc... all happened and I ended up selling all of my Canon gear, lights and accompanying stuff.

Over the last few years I've briefly gotten back into via the excellent [Moment Lenses](http://www.shopmoment.com), but I've never really committed to shooting regularly. And look, me not shooting regularly is no great loss for the art world, the photography world or anyone Well, you see, except for me. I'm happier when I'm creating and making.Whether it's writing code, jotting down notes in a journal or taking photographs I'm a better, healthier and more fulfilled person. That fits right in line with the mission at VSCO-helping people fall in love with their own creativity. With all that in mind, from today-I'm going to start taking photographs regularly. I'm going to schedule time, go shoot subjects that interest me and end up with a library of photographs. It's probably going to be painful at first-my images won't be great-they probably will be bad. I'll be embarrassed and I'll feel like a fraud. But in those moments, I'll remember that I'm not doing this to prove myself, or to measure up to someone else-I'm doind it because it's healthy. I'm doing it because it's better to create than to consume. I'm a photographer and that makes me happy.

So, it's not that I'm going to start shooting Annie Leibovitz style portraits, or Ansel Adams landscapes, but I am going to express my creativity by making pictures. And, critically, I'm not doing it for you, or for the world. I'm doing it for me-and that's the right reason.

Alright, I kind of lied, I already went out and shot earlier today-here's an image I liked ðŸ˜Ž
