From the first time I visited in 2014, I've been fascinated with San Francisco. I'm so interested by the compactness, the ocean, the bay, the distinct neighborhoods, the bridges-all of it. I recall walking down Market with my friend Areba and telling her that "someday, I'd live here."

If I'm being all the way honest, I'm not sure how much I meant it. Life has a way of getting on and the years race by and life is complext and so on and so forth. Well, Jackie and I came to visit a couple of friends at the end of April and after 2 days of exploring we made the decision that now was the time to try and move to California (maybe it was the wine...). I was still a bit skeptical about us _actually_ moving. I was certain, and told Jacke as much, that "finding a job will take the rest of the year". I was wrong. I had an offer before the end of May.

It's all been a bit of a blur, with the exception of the (customary) 8 weeks of notice I gave my Ameriprise. Those last 4 weeks crawled by. Anyway, there's a lot more to unpack about the decision, the job, the move and so much more-and it ain't happening in this post. Instead, here's a couple of valuable lessons I've learned across a multitude of topics.

- Don't give more than 4 weeks notice when quitting a job. By the 6th week, people who were previously shocked and sad you resigned are now looking at you like "WTF are you still here". I know, I know, they depend on you, yada yada yada...don't do it.
- It's called BART, not "The BART"
- When you tell people you are moving to San Francisco they have a pathological need to tell you that "it's expensive out there". Right. I get it.
- Best part of living at the top of a hill, the view! (See photo at end of post)
- The worst part of living at the top of a hill, you ALWAYS have to walk up a big damn hill to get home.
- You can walk a lot here. A LOT.
- You'll quickly start to complain about it being "too hot" when it hits 75 degrees.
- If you've felt stuck in a job or like you can't leave because it's scary, it is scary. But, there is life after wherever it is you are today. You got this.
