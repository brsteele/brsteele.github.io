<h1 class="headline">About Me</h1>
<hr class="small" />
<p class="site-text">
Hello, I'm Brian! I'm a JavaScript engineer with 7+ years of experience writing some really good (and really bad) JS. I've spent the last few years in engineering leadership building teams that build things. I'm currently living in San Francisco and working at <a href="https://www.vsco.co">VSCO</a> as an engineering manager (and loving it!). 
</p>

When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my kids, my S.O. or/and my dog Hamilton. Also, running and cycling are the activities-du-jour (mainly to allow me to continue my üçï habit without too much consequence). Finally, I'm starting to dabble in photography again-way back in the 2010 era, I did it for a living, now it's a hobby. You can see some of my stuff <a href="https://www.vsco.co/gobriango">here</a>.
